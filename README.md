# GraphQL

I started Leanrning GraphQl, and i have made progress to c certain level.
I have learnt Querying and Mutation.

Incase You are wondering what graphql is, it is a query Language, and it is platform agnostic.
It helps to query database without having to get a whole lot of stuff from our database. This problem was solved by facebook.

I used graphiql and node JS to serve the page on the browser.
I created a type for the fields i want to query (books, book(id), author(id), authors) in my own case.
Then i went ahead to create a query section that would be coupled with the export statement, and then imported in the app.js file

Mutations are for C U D operations. CREATE UPDATE DELETE operations.
It helps to add, update and delete from and to our Database.
It is also coupled with the export statement so as to be imported in the app.js file.
